# Employee performance prediction
Employee performance prediction using machine learning involves developing a model that can assess and forecast an employee's future performance based on historical data and various influencing factors. The process begins with collecting relevant data, such as demographic details, job- related information, past performance metrics, and behavioral patterns. Once trained, the model can predict future performance, helping organizations identify high-performing employees, those who may need additional support, or even those at risk of leaving. 

## How model works?
-> Input Data:
The first step involves gathering relevant data about employees.
Enter all Employee related as instructed into the form below.
This data is essential for our model to make a precise classification.
Ensure you provide all required details for the best results.

-> Submit Your Data:
Click the 'Submit' button to send your data to our model.
Thesubmission process securely transmits your information for analysis.

->Data Processing:
Our advanced machine learning model processes the submitted data.
Trained on the Employee performance prediction dataset, the model analyzes the characteristics of your galaxy to determine its subclass.

->Receive Prediction:
The predictions generated by the model can be interpreted to provide actionable insights for HR teams.
